# Email Setup Instructions for Contact Form

Your contact form currently uses a **mailto:** link, which opens the visitor's email client. This works immediately without any setup!

## Current Setup (No Configuration Needed)

âœ… **Mailto Link** - When visitors click "Send via Email", it opens their default email client with:
- Your email: pranavraskar02@gmail.com
- Subject line with their name
- Message body with their contact info and message

This works right away, but requires visitors to have an email client installed.

## Want Automatic Email Delivery? (Optional Upgrade)

If you want messages sent directly to your inbox without opening an email client, here are easy options:

### Option 1: Web3Forms (Easiest - 5 Minutes Setup)

**Why Web3Forms?** Free, no backend code needed, works instantly.

1. Go to https://web3forms.com
2. Sign up for a free account (no credit card needed)
3. Get your Access Key from the dashboard
4. Open `app/page.tsx` and find the `handleSubmit` function
5. Replace the mailto code with this:

\`\`\`typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setIsSubmitting(true)
  setSubmitStatus("idle")

  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.web3forms.com/submit', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        access_key: 'YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY_HERE', // Paste your key here
        name: formData.name,
        email: formData.email,
        message: formData.message,
        to: 'pranavraskar02@gmail.com'
      })
    })

    if (response.ok) {
      setSubmitStatus("success")
      setFormData({ name: "", email: "", message: "" })
      setTimeout(() => setSubmitStatus("idle"), 5000)
    } else {
      setSubmitStatus("error")
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error submitting form:", error)
    setSubmitStatus("error")
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false)
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Formspree (Also Easy)

1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Sign up and create a new form
3. Get your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)
4. Replace the fetch URL in the code above with your Formspree endpoint
